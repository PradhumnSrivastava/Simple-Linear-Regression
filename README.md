# Simple Linear Regression Model: Predicting Package from CPGA

## Overview
This project presents a basic Simple Linear Regression model to predict a student's salary package based on their CPGA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). The objective is to explore the linear relationship between academic performance and the package offered during campus placements.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains two columns:
  - **CPGA**: Represents the student's academic score.
  - **Package**: Corresponds to the salary package offered (in LPA).
- The data may be synthetic or based on sample placement statistics.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Python libraries used:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `Google Colab`
  - `Seaborn`

## How to Run
1. Download or clone this repository to your system.
2. Open the `linear_regression.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Ensure the dataset file `data.csv` is in the same directory.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train the model and visualize the results.

## Code Structure
- `linear_regression.ipynb`: Notebook containing code for data processing, model training, prediction, and plotting.
- `data.csv`: Dataset file with CPGA and Package columns.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Example Output
- Displays the slope and intercept of the regression line.
- Generates predictions for given CPGA values.
- Produces a scatter plot of the data points with the fitted regression line.

## Credits
This project was created as part of a learning exercise. Dataset and base logic were inspired by educational tutorials available online.
